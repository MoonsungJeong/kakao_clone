Kakao Clone version 2


Update

Javascript is added.

Files are united to one file(main.html) and controled by Javascript.

Javascript control CSS "display" to change screen


There are 2 type of "script.js" files.

One is in lib folder.

The other one is in origin folder.

"lib/sciprt.js" is made with "module.js". but it doesn't work without server.

so i made "./script.js" without "module.js" and it works without server.
